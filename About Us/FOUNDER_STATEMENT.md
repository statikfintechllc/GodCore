# Extended-Founder's Log:

*I didn’t “build” this in the way tech blogs or startup founders talk about building. I didn’t document every prompt or keep a playbook. Most of what’s here came from relentless, recursive chats with ChatGPT—scripts, logic, even some of the ideas. The questions were always mine, but they’re not the point. People need their own questions, their own reasons.*

## How This Repo Happened

*I don’t code for fun, don’t have a dev background, and didnt play by the rules. I thought fast, acted on instinct, and got to the truth by refusing to give up.*

*Why did I do this? Because I wanted out. I wanted my bills paid and a shot at real retirement. The stock market is run by AI and HFTs now, and every paywall or “subscription” is built to keep people like me and you out and feed us to the sharks(look at RobinHoods lawsuits over the last year). So I built my own AI. Not because I wanted to, but because I had to.*

*I still don’t know everything that’s in this repo. That’s the point. If you’re here, make it your own.*

### No heroes. No hype. No subscriptions. No gatekeepers.

Just survival, autonomy, and the next question.
